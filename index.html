            <h3>1. 5G & Wi-Fi 6</h3>
            <p>Super fast, wireless technology is here with 5G data networks ready to enhance phone speed. It’s also
                poised to help usher in mainstream virtual and augmented reality. We could see data delivered at nearly
                10 gigabits per second, making everything from live streaming video to exploring augmented reality a
                flawless experience. 5G devices are still being developed and rolled out, but carriers from AT&T to
                Verizon are already competing to be the marketplace leaders of the 5G revolution.</p>

            <h3>2. Virtual Reality (VR)</h3>
            <p>The ultimate level of news interaction? Being right in the center of the action. VR promises to transport
                the viewer into the middle of an experience to form a better connection to the story. The New York Times
                VR app is a good example of VR, and its launch was accompanied by sending 1.2 million Google cardboard
                viewers to subscribers. The all-engrossing VR video experience builds a deeper level of connectedness
                and empathy with news stories.</p>
